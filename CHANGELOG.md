See: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)

## [0.9.0]

### Added
* Added the _source_ and _javadoc_ package plugins to the POM.
* A linter check for `$id` values that have an empty fragment, for Draft 2019-09
  and later.

### Changed
* The EMAIL regex in Format now disallows local parts starting with a dot,
  ending with a dot, or containing two consecutive dots.
* URI and hostname parsing is now down with local code in the
  `com.qindesign.net` package.
* New internal URI and hostname parsing and handling. There's a new
  `com.qindesign.net` package containing `URI` and `Hostname` classes. `URI`
  replaces `java.net.URI` and `Hostname` handles both regular and IDN
  hostname parsing.
